#this program will print
#the sum of two floating point numbers,
#the difference between two integers,
#and and the product of a floating point number
#and an integer

#n1 and n2 will combine to find the sum
n1 = 4.27
n2 = 10.3
#add the sum of two floating numbers
n = n1 + n2
#display the sum
print(n)

#n3 and n4 will produce the difference between two integers
n3 = 20
n4 = 14
#find the difference between the two integers
n = (n4 - n3)
#display the difference
print(n)

#n5 and n6 will produce the product of a 
#floating point number and an integer
n5 = 2.2
n6 = 10
#find the product between floating point
#number and the integer
n = (n5 * n6)
#display the product
print(n)
